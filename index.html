    Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known,
     is dummy text used in laying out print, 
     graphic or web designs.

      The passage is attributed to an unknown typesette
      in the 15th century who is thought to
       have scrambled parts of Cicero's 
       De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for use
        in a type specimen book. It usually begins with:

“Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
 consectetur adipiscing elit,
  sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et
   dolore magna aliqua.”The purpose of lorem ipsum 
   is to create a natural
 looking block of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.)
 hat doesn't distract from the layout.
  A practice not without controversy, 
  laying out pages with meaningless filler text can be 
  very useful when the focus is meant to be on design,
   not content.
